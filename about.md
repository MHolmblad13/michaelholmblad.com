Hi, my name is Michael Holmblad and this is my base on the internet. I'm a programmer/analyst that is a Master's student at Villanova University. If you are seeking professional information, check out my resume. There is some personal info about me below. I have a posts section, which will contain blog posts and other thoughts that I have. There is a projects section which will contain information about side projects that I am working on or projects I have done in school.
